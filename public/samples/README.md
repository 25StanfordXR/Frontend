# Sample SPZ Files

Place your sample SPZ files in this directory for easy testing.

## How to Use Sample Files

1. Place your `.spz` files in this folder
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Access files at: `http://localhost:3000/samples/your-file.spz`
4. Use this URL in the viewer's "Load from URL" input

## Where to Find SPZ Files

SPZ files are created from:
- 3D Gaussian Splatting training pipelines
- NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) conversions
- Photogrammetry processing tools
- LiDAR scan conversions

## File Requirements

- Format: `.spz`
- Compatible with Spark.js v0.1.10+
- Typically 1MB - 100MB+ depending on scene complexity

## Example URLs

If you don't have SPZ files, you can search for publicly available Gaussian Splat demos online and use their URLs directly in the viewer.
